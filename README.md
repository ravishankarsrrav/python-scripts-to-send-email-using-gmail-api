### Steps to generate the API to access gmail.

```
1. You need a google account - either google apps or gmail. So, if you haven't got one, go get one.
2. Get yourself to the [developers console](https://console.developers.google.com)
3. Create a new project, and wait few seconds for that to complete.
4. Navigate to API's and Auth -> Credentials
5. Under OAuth select Create New Client ID
6. Choose Installed Application as the application type **Other**
7. You should now have a button Download JSON. Do that. It's your client_secret.jsonâ€”the passwords so to speak
8. copy downloaded client_secret.json into credentials.json
```

## Running the script

```
python send-email.py --noauth_local_webserver
```


### After running the script console will ask you to enter the verification code

Below one is just a demo please go through the link given in your console

>https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fgmail.compose&redirect_uri=urnAoaut2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&client_id=clientid.apps.googleusercontent.com&access_type=offline

> Please copy the link and enter in the browser then allow your Gmail account to give access to your application

> And then copy the verification code into console then click enter your email will be sent and
